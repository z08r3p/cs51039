(max 1 point) 
Task 4-3: Calculate the Depreciation Value 
Calculate the depreciation value of the car you selected across the two locations and compare the values. Note that there are several options to choose from when calculating the depreciation of a car, for example, the straight-line depreciation method or you can use a simple or multiple linear regression model. 
(max 2 points) 
Task 4-4: Price Prediction
